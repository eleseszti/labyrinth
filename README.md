# Labyrinth

Labyrinth is a simple game created with Java

## Description

Labyrinth is a single-player game. The player needs to escape from a labyrinth and avoid the dragon on the loose. The game isn't so simple though - the player can only see in a certain radius around him. Where could the dragon be?

## How to play

Move around by using the W-A-S-D and the arrow keys. The player moves until it hits a wall or meets the dragon - in this case, he jumps back to level 1. 

On every level, there is only one exit and there are 10 levels in total.
